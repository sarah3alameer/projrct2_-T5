Description:

An application specialized in Saudi real estate, and it is a 100% Saudi application that aims to activate electronic real estate marketing. 
The real estate market in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has witnessed great prosperity, and with the development of technology, reliance on phone applications to find the right property has become great.
To add a competitive advantage that distinguishes us from the applications in the market, we seek to analyze Saudi real estate data by predicting the price based on price and area.


Question: 

What is the expected price of the residential plot?
